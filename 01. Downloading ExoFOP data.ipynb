    "We first start by defining the url that we would like to download from. The url listed here is for the list of all TOIs and provides columns that are delimited using a pipe, '|'. As some text fields routinely use commas, the pipe-delimited format is more robust for being read in and parsed in Python. The url for a pipe-delimited format of a table on ExoFOP can be found by looking for an option under 'download table' similar to the TOI table's option of \"All rows (pipe)\" (red box).\n",

As additional parameters, we specify the delimiter and set the index column to 1. Setting the index column in this way means that the index column will be the TOI number. This will mean that we can use the TOI number to easily look up a line of data rather than try to match column values.\n",

First, we print out the 'TFOPWG Disposition' column, which will list the index (the TOI number) and the 'TFOPWG Disposition' for the TOIs in the table. We can also select a paricular TOI by using the TOI number to specify a single item. TOIs that have a blank TFOPWG Disposition will show up here as 'NaN', and these generally represent TOIs that are still active candidates that have not yet been identified as either a false positive or a confirmed planet.\n",

    "We can also use some additional funtions of pandas data frames to explore the 'TFOPWG Disposition' column. The value_counts() function provides a count of how many occurences of each disposition are in the TOI list. By default, value_counts() will ignore any 'NaN' values but we can include them by setting dropna=False. Generally, these can be thought of as the same as having a PC disposition.\n",
