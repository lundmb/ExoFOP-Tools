    "One of the additional features on ExoFOP is the <A HREF=https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/mytargets.php>'MyTargets'</A> functionality that lets users request information on if user-selected TOIs have received updates on ExoFOP by submitting a file and receiving an email. This list can be submitted manually through ExoFOP, and the ExoFOP help page explains how to submit this as a curl request that can be set up as a scheduled cron job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we demonstrate how MyTargets requests can be scheduled using Python by first creating a target list using tools in the first notebook. Using `pandas` we first load the TOI data from ExoFOP as we did in Notebook 01."

    "To generate a list of targets for our MyTargets submission, we will pick planet candidates that are warm Jupiters as the subset of TOIs that we would like to get information on. To do that, are going to use `pandas` .loc indexing option and some boolean statements to select just a subset of the TOIs.  \n",
