    "A number of php scripts are available for more easily accessing data. Broadly, these can be separated into those that that will download files and those that will return text. Summaries of scripts are presented below, and the path for all scripts begins with \"https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some php scripts have additional terms that may be used. For a php call with additional parameters, a question mark follows '.php' and is followed by the first parameter. In the case of multiple parameters, these should be separated by '&'.\n",

    "For those that return text, there are a few formatting options that may be available. They are described here, and each entry will note which of these options is available.\n",
